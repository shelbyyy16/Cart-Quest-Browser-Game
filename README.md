## Game Title: Cart Quest
Game Background: As you are heading out the door your nosey neighbor notices your re-usable grocery bags and their eyes light up. They quickly shove a grocery list into your hand, yell "Thanks!" and shut the door before you know what just happened. *Sigh*

Cart Quest is a short term memory game that consists of being displayed a sequence and repeating it back. With each level successfully beaten, the next level gets harder, adding more to the sequence each time.
